# onVoiceCommand-playTimestamp
A voice command / buttons that plays recording from a live file or a saved one . 

I was thinking about a tool that might be useful for doing any kind of interview.
What I want is an easy way to play recording from a specific file, or a live recording. (Using an interface or a voice command.)
